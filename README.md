The objective of Blackjack is to accumulate cards with total value as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21 ('going bust').
The value of a hand is the sum of the point counts of each card in the hand. The value assigned to cards is as follows:

The cards from 2 through 10 are valued as indicated.

Face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are all valued at 10 points.

An Ace counts as 1 or 11. It is worth 11 unless that would cause hand value to exceed 21 (bust), in which case it has a value of 1.

Soft total: A hand containing an Ace that can be counted as 11 without the total going above 21. For example, Ace-6 is soft 17.

Hard total: A hand containing an Ace that can be counted as only 1 because counting it as 11 would make the hand go over 21. For example, Ace-6-10 is hard 17.

A tie between the player and the house is known as a 'push', and means that no one wins or loses. If the first two cards dealt are an Ace and any 10-point card, it is known as  blackjack, and is an automatic win for the player at 1.5 to 1, unless the house ties.
